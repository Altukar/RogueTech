Streak MRM: +1 evasion ignore

ER Flamer and ER Flamer (C) are now the same item as in lore.

No more RISC mechs in start lists. <--- Maybe just don't tell players this :P

LRM Mine Clear [Half] - Fixed tonnage, and name.

Protective Padding: Effects limited to install location. 25% crit resist. 33% through armor damage resist. Limit 1 per location.

Quirk QuikSell: Crits taken and panic chance malus reduced from 50% to 33%. (20 mission affinity now results in a net aprox 14% bonus to these stats.)

Tweaked tanks to be less scared of being in melee range, and VTOLs to maybe want to shoot more then zoom and not worry about their butts quite so much.

Telos: Removed.

New heavy VTOL family: Lindwyrm, a budget Nidhogg, or a heavier slower Ifrit, depending on perspective.

New Heavy Tank family Pitbull - Speciation event; We had too many Bulldog tanks but also needed more 60 ton MBT.
