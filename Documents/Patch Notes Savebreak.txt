Savebreak notes:

Notes that matter to gameplay:

Vehicle prices rescaled - Was previously cbill cost of core and engine type items, now uses Tabletop calculations.
ICE powered vehicles in shops are significantly cheaper, they are accessible at career start and available to players with more cash as an expendable commodity.
VTOL 30 tons and under cost reduced up to 50%
Vehicles with large fusion engines, especially XL sometimes more expensive.

MMS Tandem Nerfed - Damage -2 to -3, Ammo count 300 to 200, incorrectly high crit stats reduced.

ER Flamer and ER Flamer (C) are now the same item as in lore.

No more RISC mechs in start lists. <--- Maybe just don't tell players this :P

LRM Mine Clear [Half] - Fixed tonnage, and name.

AA iATM Rack: +1 Evasion ignored.

Protective Padding: Effects limited to install location. 25% crit resist. 33% through armor damage resist. Limit 1 per location.

Quirk QuikSell: Crits taken and panic chance malus reduced from 50% to 33%. (20 mission affinity now results in a net aprox 14% bonus to these stats.)

Tweaked tanks to be less scared of being in melee range, and VTOLs to maybe want to shoot more then zoom and not worry about their butts quite so much.

Tweaked impact VFX for non-AOE Thunderbolt Missiles for hopefully smoother more consistent explosion size.

Large Laser Igor rebuilt lower tech and a lot cheaper.
