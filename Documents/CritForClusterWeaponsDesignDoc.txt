When an LRM20 hits on TT you're probably doing to make about 3 location rolls for damage clusters. Each of which could result in a crit.
This is because the total damage of the volley is sorted in 5 damgage Clusters. And a location is rolled for each full or partial cluster.
Without adjustments, if one of our new style LRM20 hits the game will make 20 tac/crit checks. 
This is huge enough to throw things seriously out of whack if not adjusted.

Notes on how Artemis works. It increase results on the cluster table in TT.
This means that Artemis attachments should bump up average Damage, CriticalChanceMultiplier and APCriticalChanceMultiplier about 35%

Ammo that alters weapon damage should idealy have mods.

The goal here: Modify weapon CriticalChanceMultiplier so you only get about as much raw crit probabily as an average Cluster Table roll on TT. (60% hits)
Streaks will come out ahead here again because they skip the cluster table and always all hit for real.
But note that Streak LRM and similar still bundle by 5, limiting their crit potential somewhat.
SRM, Streak SRM, and LBX emerge as premier crit hunters, as it should be.


"APMinCritChance": 0.1,
StandardAPCrit = 0.05

whatever the desired minimum value at full armor is for a standard hit.

Example:
Desired starting TAC chance is 1%
Global APCritMinimum chance is: 0.1
So, StandardAPCrit for weapons is 0.1

We could use either one of these to increase TAC chance as armor gets damaged. 
Just the former is flat tac mult per weapon type.
Just the second is different tac exponents applied relative to remaining armor %
Both is also probably managable. You get TAC ranges started at X and increasing to XY

Standard AP Crit multiplier for type - effectively sets floor: 

Flamer: 0.5
Laser: 1
Missile: 1
AntiPersonel: 1
PPC/Plasma: 1.2
Ballistic: 1.4
Gauss: 2

ShardsMod multiplier by weapon type - this is the exponent for the above:

Flamer: 5
Laser: 5
Missile: 5
AntiPersonel: 5
PPC/Plasma: 5
Ballistic: 5
Gauss: 6

PPC = 1.2 * 5 = 6 = TAC chance from 1.2-6% as armor % of hit location decreases.

Things that do 1(5) damage per projectile and bundle by 5(25 Damage) in TT:

LRM, MRM -
CriticalChanceMultiplier = 0.12 (1/5*0.6)
APCriticalChanceMultiplier =  CriticalChanceMultiplier*StandardAPCrit                   
Intent: 20 probjectiles gives 2.4 'full' crit chances. It would be 4, but we're abstracting some missing.

Things that do 1(5) damage per projectile and bundle by 5(25 Damage) in TT, and are Streak:

Streak LRM/MRM -
CriticalChanceMultiplier = 0.2
APCriticalChanceMultiplier = (StandardAPCrit/5)
Intent: 20 projectiles gives 4 'full' crit chances. Since streaks all hit for really real they get a full crit check for every 5 missiles.

Things that do 1(5) damage per projectile and bundle by 5(25 Damage) in TT
...but don't do a nominal 5 damage per hit in our implimentation 

HAG -
CriticalChanceMultiplier = 0.3
APCriticalChanceMultiplier =  CriticalChanceMultiplier*StandardAPCrit 
Intent: Same chance as LRM but for situation where projectiles are already merged 2/1 for other reasons.

Things that do 2(10) per projectile but bundle by 5(25) damage.

Mortar -
CriticalChanceMultiplier = 0.3 
APCriticalChanceMultiplier = CriticalChanceMultiplier*StandardAPCrit
Intent: 8 tubes gives 2.4 'full' crit chances. It would be 4 but we're abstracting some missing.

Things that does 2(10) per projectile but bundle by 5(25) damage. And have built in Artemis.

ATM - Needs mods for ammo!
CriticalChanceMultiplier = 0.32
APCriticalChanceMultiplier = CriticalChanceMultiplier*StandardAPCrit
Intent: 12 tubes of Standard gives 3.84 'full' crit chances. It would be 4.8 but we're abstracting some missing.

Things that does 2(10) per projectile but bundle by 5(25) damage. And are Streak:

iATM - Needs mods for ammo! Needs mods in Indirect mode.
CriticalChanceMultiplier = 0.40
APCriticalChanceMultiplier = (StandardAPCrit/5)*2
Intent: 12 tubes of Standard gives 4.8 'full' crit chances.

Things that multihit but don't bundle in TT:

SRM -
CriticalChanceMultiplier = 0.6
APCriticalChanceMultiplier = StandardAPCrit*0.6
Intent: Basic Pesudo Cluster Hit Table concept, we're abstracting an average number of crit checks.

Things that are multi-hit but don't bundle and are Streak:

Streak SRM -
CriticalChanceMultiplier = 1
APCriticalChanceMultiplier = StandardAPCrit
Intent: Since streaks all hit for really real, and SRM roll for location individually, they get a full crit check each.
