When an LRM20 hits on TT you're probably doing to make about 3 location rolls for damage clusters. Each of which could result in a crit.
Without adjustments, if one of our new style LRM20 hits the game will make 20 tac/crit checks. This is big enough to thow things seriously out of whack.

Notes on how Artemis works. It increase results on the cluster table in TT.
This means that Artemis attachments should bump up average Damage, CriticalChanceMultiplier and APCriticalChanceMultiplier about 35%

Ammo that alters weapon damage should idealy have mods.

The goal here: Modify weapon CriticalChanceMultiplier so you only get about as much raw crit probabily as an average Cluster Table roll on TT.
Streaks will come out ahead here again because they skip the cluster table and always all hit for real.
But note that Streak LRM and similar still bundle by 5, limiting their crit potential somewhat.
SRM, Streak SRM, and LBX emerge as premier crit hunters, as it should be.


StandardAPCrit = whatever the desired minimum value at full armor is for a standard hit.

Example:
Desired starting TAC chance is 1%
Global APCritMin is: 0.1
So, StandardAPCrit for weapons is 0.1


Things that do 1(5) damage per projectile and bundle by 5(25 Damage) in TT:

LRM, MRM, HAG:

CriticalChanceMultiplier = 0.15
APCriticalChanceMultiplier =  CriticalChanceMultiplier*StandardAPCrit                                    ((StandardAPCrit/5)*0.75))

Intent: 20 probjectiles gives 3 'full' crit chances. It would be 4, but we're abstracting some missing.

Streak LRM/MRM: 

CriticalChanceMultiplier = 0.2
APCriticalChanceMultiplier = (StandardAPCrit/5)

Intent: 20 projectiles gives 4 'full' crit chances. Since streaks all hit for really real they get a full crit check for every 5 missiles.

Things that do more than 2(10) per projectile but bundle by 5(25) damage.

Mortar
CriticalChanceMultiplier = 0.375 
APCriticalChanceMultiplier = CriticalChanceMultiplier*StandardAPCrit

Intent: 8 tubes gives 3 'full' crit chances. It would be 4 but we're abstracting some missing.

Things that do more than 2(10) per projectile but bundle by 5(25) damage. And have built in Artemis.

ATM - Needs mods for ammo!

CriticalChanceMultiplier = 0.3334
APCriticalChanceMultiplier = CriticalChanceMultiplier*StandardAPCrit

Intent: 12 tubes of Standard gives 4 'full' crit chances. It would be 5 but we're abstracting some missing.

iATM - Needs mods for ammo!

CriticalChanceMultiplier = 0.4167
APCriticalChanceMultiplier = (StandardAPCrit/5)*2

Intent: 12 tubes of Standard gives 5 'full' crit chances.

Things that multihit but don't bundle in TT:

SRM, LBX cluster ammo.

CriticalChanceMultiplier = 0.6
APCriticalChanceMultiplier = StandardAPCrit*0.6

Intent: Basic Pesudo Cluster Hit Table concept, we're assuming an average number of crit checks.

Streak SRM
CriticalChanceMultiplier = 1
APCriticalChanceMultiplier = StandardAPCrit

Intent: Since streaks all hit for really real, and SRM roll for location individually, they get a full crit check each.
