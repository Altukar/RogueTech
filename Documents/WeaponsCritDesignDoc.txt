Context: This file was written during the making of the currently unamed major update after Lance-A-Lot. It describes reworking TAC, and calculating crit values for weapons that use the Cluster Hit Table in TT. 

APCriticalChanceMultiplier = CriticalChanceMultiplier*StandardAPCrit*

When an LRM20 hits on TT you're probably doing to make about 3 location rolls for damage clusters. Each of which could result in a crit.
This is because the total damage of the volley is sorted in 5 damgage Clusters. And a location is rolled for each full or partial cluster.
Without adjustments, if one of our new style LRM20 hits the game will make 20 tac/crit checks. 
This is huge enough to throw things seriously out of whack if not adjusted.

Notes on how Artemis works. It increase results on the cluster table in TT.
This means that Artemis attachments should bump up average Damage, CriticalChanceMultiplier and APCriticalChanceMultiplier about 35%

Ammo that alters weapon damage should idealy have mods.

The goal here: Modify weapon CriticalChanceMultiplier so you only get about as much raw crit probabily as an average Cluster Table roll on TT. (60% hits)
Streaks will come out ahead here again because they skip the cluster table and always all hit for real.
But note that Streak LRM and similar still bundle by 5, limiting their crit potential somewhat.
SRM, Streak SRM, and LBX emerge as premier crit hunters, as it should be.



This value isn't a game stat but we'll use it in calculations:

StandardAPCrit = 0.05 

Why?:
Desired nominal starting TAC chance is 0.5%
Global APMinCritChance chance is: 0.1
So, StandardAPCrit for weapons is 0.05

0.1*X=0.005 solve for X.


-----------------------------
We need to remove this value entirely from every weapon: APMaxArmorThickness
Strike  previous sentence. We need to make sure no wweapon has both `APMaxArmorThickness` and a `APArmorShardsMod` greater than zero.
We may want some that operate with a max thickness.

Automation Ideas: treat weapon differently depending on which one of those it has. Exclude folders. Exclude by tag. So we can have weird pirate stuff etc.
If weapon has APArmorShardsMod set it's value by Category/Type
Set it's APCriticalChanceMultiplier by Category/Type

If it has APMax...
-----------------------------


We need to figure out what to set APCriticalChanceMultiplier, it's the product of 3 values.

APCriticalChanceMultiplier = CriticalChanceMultiplier*APCritTypeMultiplier*StandardAPCrit

AP Crit Type Multiplier: 

Flamer: 0.5
Laser: 1
Missile: 1
AntiPersonel: 1
PPC/Plasma: 1.5
Ballistic: 2
Gauss: 3

We need to set this value on every weapon based on Type: APArmorShardsMod

ShardsMod by weapon type:

Flamer: 4
Laser: 4
Missile: 5
AntiPersonel: 4
PPC/Plasma: 4
Ballistic: 4
Gauss: 5
TAG: 0
NARC: 5
Other/Unknown: 2

Pseudo Cluster Hit Table Crit Values

Things that do 1(5) damage per projectile and bundle by 5(25 Damage) in TT:

LRM, MRM -
CriticalChanceMultiplier = 0.12 (1/5*0.6)
APCriticalChanceMultiplier =  CriticalChanceMultiplier*StandardAPCrit                   
Intent: 20 probjectiles gives 2.4 'full' crit chances. It would be 4, but we're abstracting some missing.

Things that do 1(5) damage per projectile and bundle by 5(25 Damage) in TT, and are Streak:

Streak LRM/MRM -
CriticalChanceMultiplier = 0.2
APCriticalChanceMultiplier = (StandardAPCrit/5)
Intent: 20 projectiles gives 4 'full' crit chances. Since streaks all hit for really real they get a full crit check for every 5 missiles.

Things that do 1(5) damage per projectile and bundle by 5(25 Damage) in TT
...but don't do a nominal 5 damage per hit in our implimentation 

HAG -
CriticalChanceMultiplier = 0.3
APCriticalChanceMultiplier =  CriticalChanceMultiplier*StandardAPCrit 
Intent: Same chance as LRM but for situation where projectiles are already merged 2/1 for other reasons.

Things that do 2(10) per projectile but bundle by 5(25) damage.

Mortar -
CriticalChanceMultiplier = 0.3 
APCriticalChanceMultiplier = CriticalChanceMultiplier*StandardAPCrit
Intent: 8 tubes gives 2.4 'full' crit chances. It would be 4 but we're abstracting some missing.

Things that does 2(10) per projectile but bundle by 5(25) damage. And have built in Artemis.

ATM - Needs mods for ammo!
CriticalChanceMultiplier = 0.32
APCriticalChanceMultiplier = CriticalChanceMultiplier*StandardAPCrit
Intent: 12 tubes of Standard gives 3.84 'full' crit chances. It would be 4.8 but we're abstracting some missing.

Things that does 2(10) per projectile but bundle by 5(25) damage. And are Streak:

iATM - Needs mods for ammo! Needs mods in Indirect mode.
CriticalChanceMultiplier = 0.40
APCriticalChanceMultiplier = (StandardAPCrit/5)*2
Intent: 12 tubes of Standard gives 4.8 'full' crit chances.

Things that multihit but don't bundle in TT:

SRM -
CriticalChanceMultiplier = 0.6
APCriticalChanceMultiplier = StandardAPCrit*0.6
Intent: Basic Pesudo Cluster Hit Table concept, we're abstracting an average number of crit checks, whichh is 60% of missiles.

Things that are multi-hit but don't bundle and are Streak:

Streak SRM -
CriticalChanceMultiplier = 1
APCriticalChanceMultiplier = StandardAPCrit
Intent: Since streaks all hit for really real, and SRM roll for location individually, they get a full crit check each.
