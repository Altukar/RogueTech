INTRODUCTION

Roguetech is a massive project with a huge number of contributors and a history spanning several years. This definitely a beautiful thing, but as with all projects that have a large number people working on it, inconsistencies ranging from terminology and text formatting to definition styles and simple typos and grammar issues tend to crop up.

I'm hoping that with my decade and a half long experience in technical writing and UI text editing and writing, I could provide improvements to Roguetech resulting in the kind of consistency and quality I would be looking for in any professional setting.

I'm on the RT and RTO Discord as Kheyviii, feel free to reach out with any questions and suggestions!

DESCRIPTION OF PLANNED CHANGES

I'm planning on working on the existing content in separate phases. First of all to simply familiarize myself with the actual project files and to see how much work I'm actually looking at, and secondly to allow for discussions of the planned changes before actual implementation. 


	PHASE ONE

	Simple grammar and text editing across any and all UI elements. This means fixing typos and rewriting confusing or otherwise convoluted text content wherever it may appear. I have a personal collection of issues needing a fix that I've collected during my time playing RT. These range from unit and item descriptions, Yang's thoughts, pilot bios, event texts and Argo upgrades. I welcome anyone to provide me with their own lists of similar issues and I'll be more than happy to work on those as well. This phase could also include condensing some of the fluff texts included in unit and item descriptions to make them faster to read and to shorten the UI card.


	PHASE TWO
	
	An overarching terminology pass of all UI content. Meaning checking that all the content adheres to the same terms across all unit and item descriptions. This will also include designing a terminology list/database that could be then utilized by anyone working on the mod to ensure a consistent term usage going forward, as well as providing the same or similar list for players as well on the wiki, for example. The latter could include commonly used acronyms, terms etc. to be used for easy reference by players new to the mod or Battletech in general.
	
	
	PHASE THREE
	
	UI element content clarity, consistency and formatting pass. This phase consists of redoing some of the item descriptions, particularly regarding weapon traits text. Currently, these are rather verbose and unnecessarily long. Creating a set style of how these can be shown with as little text as possible will make the traits far easier for the user to comprehend at a glance, without needing to read through superfluous blocks of text.
	
	As an example of what this means, let's look at some of the typical trait texts:
	
		Weapon damage varies between +/-2
		Weapon has a 15% jam chance - Mitigated by Gunnery & Jam Modifiers
		Weapon is capable of Indirect fire with LRM Ammo
		This weapon has a recoil of 2
		When this weapon would jam, it misfires damaging itself. But it remains operational unless destroyed.
		-1 accuracy with this ammo
		LRM AMMO - 60 Shots
	
	
	The above examples could be condensed quite extensively without losing any of the necessary info:
	
		Damage variance +/-2
		Jam chance 15% - Gunnery and Jam mods mitigate *
		Indirect fire with LRM ammo
		Recoil 2
		Jams cause a misfire resulting in self-damage **
		Accuracy -1
		60 shots

	[*an even more consistent way to indicate mitigation could be devised]
	[**weapons misfiring could simply use the term misfire, i.e. "Misfire chance 15%"]

	I.e., we don't need to repeat the word Weapon or Ammo, the user already knows from the context that we're talking about the weapon or ammo description by virtue of that being the title of the item card in question. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to organize all of this information in a set order so that you can always see the necessary info at a glance. In other words, the order of information for a weapon for example could always be: 
	
	Accuracy
	Recoil
	DMG var.
	Jam %
	
	
	Another example of consistency improvements would be the weather descriptions. Currently they are not always very clear on what exactly is the visibility, for example. Sometimes they say things like "Visibility is lowered by 15%", at others it's "Visibility is 60% of normal", and sometimes "Visibility is normal for nighttime". These could all be replaced by a consistent visibility percentage, i.e. "Visibility is 75%".

CLOSING WORDS

I know the above is going to be a lot of work, and I'm aware that I'd be editing texts written by several different people over a long period of time. My intention is to contact everyone individually before making any changes, since I'm aware that I'm touching stuff that's owned by someone else. If you want to give your blanket pass for some or all of the above changes for content owned by you, please let me know. And, I welcome all discussions and suggestions regarding what I'm proposing above.
