    "Details": "One of two known pirates known to terrorize the Outer Rim, Tao \"Tock\" Xu was found in a basket on Tortuga, colored in the usual House Liao banners. Life on the coastal bandit worlds of the Periphery was a constant battle for survival, and he quickly found he had a penchant for destruction. After he joined the pirate organization \"Blackguards of Tortuga\", Tao became acquainted with his soon-to-be lackey, \"Tick\". The nervous wreck of a pirate seemed to somehow restrain Xu's wanton violence enough for him to earn a decent wage and be able to \"preserve\" some treasure from the remains littering the battlefield.\n\n",
