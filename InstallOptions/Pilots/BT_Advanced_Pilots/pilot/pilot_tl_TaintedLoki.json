    "Details": "Artemus left his birthplace as a young man to pursue the life of a mercenary. He spent years traveling around the Inner Sphere and saw combat in various engagements - facing mostly pirates, but also the Clans on a few occasions.\r\n\r\nWhen the hostilities cooled, Artemus took the opportunity to travel to Canopian space to relax for a few years. It didn't take long for things to heat back up though, and during a pirate raid he fired up a nearby BattleMech to take the fight to the local pirates.\r\n\r\nNow he is traveling the stars once again as a merc, occasionally designing new 'Mech variants for clients - and looking for interesting times.\n\n",
