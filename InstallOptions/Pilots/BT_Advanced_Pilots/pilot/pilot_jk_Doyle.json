    "Details": "Doyle is a seasoned mercenary pilot who started his career with the Ghost Warriors Brigade. He quickly got frustrated with their lack of drive and ambition, and soon found himself signing up and fighting with the Steel Jaguars, a merc unit that prided themselves on their dedication to tough training, hard work and excellence in the field of battle. Before too long, Doyle had become an integral part of the battalion he fought for. He found himself fighting in every available mission, building up a wealth of knowledge and experience, and eventually he was given a promotion. But it was his next promotion, the one that he never wanted, that would end up shaping his future.\r\n\r\nOne day, their Commanding Officer walked away after deciding that he was unable to continue in his position. The CO quitting the life of a mercenary left Doyle to take on his post. Doyle didn't want this position but, after looking around and deciding that if he left it to someone else they would probably get him killed, he decided to take the job. He led the battalion through a series of successful missions, but never truly saw eye to eye with the company's owner. There were many straws but - as they say - the last one finally broke the camel's back, and Doyle decided to leave the Steel Jaguars to form his own company from the ground up.\r\n\r\nWhat he didn't expect was for the vast majority of his former battalion to follow him, but so they did. Finding himself in possession of almost a full battalion's worth of seasoned merc pilots, he struck out with his new company after naming them The Sanguine Tigers. Years later, a merge with a friendly fellow merc unit - known as 9th Blood and Fire - saw the company renamed to The 9th Sanguine Tigers, and they spent many happy years taking contracts and kicking ass. Until, one day, Doyle decided he needed a change of pace. To give up the life of a merc and to settle down. Which he tried to do, but not before a brief but lucrative spell as a Solaris VII jock...\r\n\r\nOld habits die hard, however, and it turned out the peaceful life wasn't for him after all. He set out once more to find the thrill of the battlefield, working for any company that was happy to take on a grizzled old veteran pilot - as long as they promised to never give him a promotion.\n\n",
