    "Details": "John was on a fast track to command straight out of Albion Military Academy. However, while attached to the Ceti Hassars, he was captured by a Capellan patrol after an intel snafu failed to warn them of recent movements in the area. Beagle was held prisoner for 4 years and was subjected to intense interrogation techniques in the early years of his captivity. On the fourth year, Beagle was sprung from prison by his old unit - now operating as a mercenary band - and would assist in combat and command of what would later be known as Operation Gatecrasher. John has been running his own mercenary unit on and off since his newfound freedom, but has recently been looking for a company where he can find good return for his skills and experience.\n\n",
