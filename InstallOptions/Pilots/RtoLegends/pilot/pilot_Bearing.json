    "Details": "A former Khan of Clan Star Adder, Bearing oversaw its expansion from a relatively minor Clan into a powerhouse within the Kerensky Cluster. Although not able to translate that success into his attempts to claim territory within the Inner Sphere, Bearing nonetheless became one of the Clan's most respected Khans. A fierce military leader, Bearing was also well known for his knowledge of LosTech, even amongst the Clans. Clan records do also note his dislike of advanced Star League era AI however, including his relentless attempts to torture such an AI, one known only as \"RogueBot\".\n\n",
