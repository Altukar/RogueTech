    "Details": "Takashi Kurita is one of the more mysterious members of the storied Kurita House. He once served as the Coordinator of the Draconis Combine during one of its most troubled times. Takashi's reign was marred by attacks of a resurgent JarnFolk, and the Combine suffered greatly at the hands of their raids.\r\n\r\nLike his other contemporaries, Takashi nearly formed the so-called 'Third Star League', almost assuredly because of the Combine's dire need. While Takashi was able to escape from the disaster that was meant to be the signing of the new Star League accords on St. Ives, the experience shattered the once proud Coordinator's psyche.\r\n\r\nUpon hearing rumors that the JarnFolk devastating his nation were secretly FWL troops dressed in viking attire, the Coordinator flew into a rage and immediately boarded one of the last WarShips remaining at the Combine's disposal and set course to Atreus. Takashi was believed killed when his WarShip was intercepted and destroyed while attempting to unleash nuclear bombardment on the FWL capital to avenge their supposed attacks on the DC. As a result, Takashi is rarely spoken about within the Combine.\n\n",
