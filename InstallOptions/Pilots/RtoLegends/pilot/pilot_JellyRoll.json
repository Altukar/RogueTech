    "Details": "Sweeny Papavic, perhaps better known by the moniker 'Sweet Papa Jelly Roll', is strange even as far as MechWarriors go.\r\n\r\nBorn in the Capellan Confederation, Jelly Roll is amongst the rare number of Capellan citizens who went on to found a hugely successful business empire. Starting from a humble food truck selling tacos, Sweet Papa quickly made a name for his delicious food and jolly demeanor, something the average Capellan does not posses. His business went on to flourish into a nation-wide chain with tens of thousands of taco trucks, that even made its way into neighboring Federated Suns and Free Worlds League worlds.\r\n\r\nWith wealth nearly unimaginable to the average spheroid and still very young, Jelly Roll took an interest in BattleMechs and started training as a MechWarrior in his spare time away from his taco truck. He was quickly found to have a knack for it, and soon enough found himself deploying alongside CCAF troops during the ComStar-Republic war.\r\n\r\nIn this war, Jelly Roll made a name for himself and ended the war in charge of a regiment of CCAF troops, and was entrusted with the hiring of mercenary forces to supplement the Capellan regulars. After the end of the war, Jelly departed the Confederation, thanks to a generous bribe to his Liao superiors. With this newfound freedom, instead of settling down to spend his wealth in a more free nation, Jelly instead traveled up to the Ghost Bear Dominion and to everyone's amazement was able to join the ranks of the touman, getting the near unheard of privilege of being treated by Clan trueborn as equals.\r\n\r\nFor the next few decades, Jelly Roll could be found deploying with Ghost Bear forces in a myriad of campaigns undertaken by the Clan, all the while getting the Clan addicted to his tacos.\r\n\r\nMost who have deployed with Jelly Roll call his demeanor refreshing and happy - not the grizzled, war-weary personality that most MechWarriors seem to take on. With his legendary cooking talents and Sphere-wide famous tacos, adding Jelly Roll to the roster is an almost surefire way to boost the morale and spirits of nearly any company.\n\n",
