    "Details": "Quizel Narf has been described as either one of the greatest or one of the worst pirate lords to have ever graced the history books.\r\n\r\nBorn on a backwater world in the Circinus Federation, Narf grew up hearing stories of daring raids, buried treasure, and fortunes won and lost. Enthralled by these tales, even if most weren't true, Narf quickly decided the pirate's life was for him and, at the young age of 17, joined his first pirate crew.\r\n\r\nThere Narf stood above his peers, proving to be both cunning, fearless, and a natural at finding hidden 'booty'. These qualities soon found Narf rising through the ranks of command until the age of 26, when the entire crew he was serving under was wiped out in a Lyran sting operation.\r\n\r\nBarely escaping himself, Narf decided to start his own crew instead of joining someone else's. It was here that Narf's true talent was discovered: his ability to recruit people to his cause. Such was his talent that before his 30th birthday, Narf found himself a pirate lord, having recruited enough people to create and run no less than a dozen different crews - all under his command.\r\n\r\nDespite his disdain for politics, Narf's power meant he was a household name within the loosely governed Federation, and he soon found himself a central figure of it. It is here that the Federation's craze with raccoons is said to have come from, as Narf was so fond of the Terran raccoon that he underwent numerous surgeries in the nearby Magistracy of Canopus until he outwardly looked like one.\r\n\r\nUpon learning of the Clan invasion of the Inner Sphere, Narf fantasized of leading the Federation to become a Clan itself, less out of a desire to be recognized as a member of a warrior-people and more because he thought it would be funny and would annoy other Clans to no end. A mere five years later, taking full advantage of the Word of Blake's Jihad, Narf and his crews manged to pull off one of the greatest feats any pirate ever has: not only landing on - but sacking - Strana Mechty itself. While Clan reinforcements drove the pirates off-world within hours and years later altered their histories to state the sacking never happened, it did not stop Narf from proclaiming himself Khan of a new Clan known as \"Skull-Squid\". While no Clan would ever recognize the claim - in fact, some actively attempted to kill the now infamous pirate lord - it did not stop Narf or his crews from using the term whenever possible.\r\n\r\nThat is not to say all of Narf's plans went off without a hitch, and one of his greatest failures came with his alliance to Hans O'Reilly and his attempt to help place him on the throne of the Marian Hegemony. When the Circinus invasion badly backfired, Narf's legendary status within the Federation was dimmed for several years.\r\n\r\nNarf's final fate is not clear. What is known is that the Republic of the Sphere attacked and tried to murder him during his own wedding, successfully assassinating his bride-to-be. Reports from the time are hazy, and it is not clear one way or another if Narf himself was killed. For years after the incident, sightings of the famous Raccoon-Pirate continued to occur, and the Federation itself grew fat off the pirate activity as it preyed on the helpless Free Worlds League. However, none of these sightings could ever be confirmed, nor could the enrichment of the Federation be directly tied to Narf.\r\n\r\nIn the end however, perhaps it doesn't matter if Narf died that day or lived to plunder for years more. His stories were already out there, his exploits both real and made up inspiring new generations of pirates. And after we are gone, our stories are what remain.\n\n",
