    "Details": "Baelin \"Braver\" Hawker was one of Clan Diamond Shark's most prestigious Khans. Over the course of his khanship, Braver expanded the size and power of the 'Merchant Clan', taking full advantage of the Sharks' mercantile and military prowess in equal measure.\r\n\r\nA true Clan warrior at heart, Braver went out of his way to make sure any battle was fought with honor, even purposefully bidding away advantages his Clan held in order to ensure a fair fight.\r\n\r\nUltimately, like most Diamond Sharks', Braver's dream was to open a great market on Terra, a goal he dedicated his life to. Armed with simulations that showed to other Clans that he could make such dreams a reality - if the Clans invaded under his leadership - Braver was eventually elected to the position of ilKhan, the only Diamond Shark ever honored this way.\n\n",
