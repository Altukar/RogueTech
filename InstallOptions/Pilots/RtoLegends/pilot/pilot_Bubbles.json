    "Details": "Little is known about the enigmatic being known as \"Mr. Bubbles\", only that references to her go back many centuries.\r\n\r\nAll-seeing, ever-present, and slow to anger, some say Mr. Bubbles is nothing more than an urban myth designed to scare MechWarriors and keep them in line. Others claim that she is a herald of an elder god known as \"Server Overlord\" and that her appearance can either mark joy and laughter or signal doom.\r\n\r\nDescriptions of Mr. Bubbles consistently describe her as donning a great metal suit that resembles ancient diver outfits from over a millennium ago now only seen in museums on Terra. It is said that those who invoke her wrath find themselves shredded by a large and powerful drill arm capable of tearing through even the hardest of armors like butter.\r\n\r\nSome sources claim that the advanced Star League era AI known as \"Roguebot\" is her pet and that she is capable of summoning minions known as voidlings to do her bidding. Others say she adores foxes and gives blessings to Clan Hell's Horses. The only concrete fact - assuming Mr. Bubbles even exists - is that she speaks an ancient Terran language known as \"gifs\".\n\n",
