    "Details": "Very little is known about Janaszar. By his own account, he was once a brilliant scientist who studied stellar phenomena before deciding to ply the mercenary trade.\r\n\r\nDespite calling himself \"Dr. Janaszar PhD\", to date no one has been able to find a single record of him at any accredited institution or proof of a doctorate or PhD, making the claim dubious at best. Regardless of this, there is no denying that the so-called doctor is extremely gifted in the art of puzzle-solving and lock-breaking.\r\n\r\nConsidered a wanted man in nearly every corner of the Inner Sphere and Periphery for strings of mysterious break-ins and theft of high tech equipment, Janaszar still has little trouble finding employment of his services due to his proficiency. Many officials choose to turn a blind eye to the arrest warrants, needing his abilities over the need to lock him up, and mostly noting that the handful of times he has been apprehended he has escaped within days or even hours, often along with some prized pieces of technology.\r\n\r\nAmongst the strange doctor's achievements he was said to have overloaded the Star League era AI known as \"Roguebot\" in order to pull off a heist. It is whispered by members of the so-called \"Server\" cult that Janaszar is a dangerous heretic, daring to not only question, but openly mock the words of the Elder God known as \"Server Overlord\". But just like anything said about Janaszar, the truth behind any of these allegations remains unknown.\n\n",
