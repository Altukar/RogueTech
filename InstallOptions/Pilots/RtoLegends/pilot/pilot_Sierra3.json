    "Details": "Hailing from the deep-periphery, the exact origins of the mercenary known as 'Sierra3' remain unknown, although a slight Spanish accent in his speech strongly suggests that he either hails from, or has spent significant time in the distant Nueva Castile.\n\nAppearing as a rough figure, often seen sporting a Stetson-styled hat and a long trench-coat, evoking images of 'Wild West' of the ancient Terran nation of America, with a personality to match. Sierra3 can be summed up as 'all business, no play' when it comes to his work and takes any job he accepts with the utmost seriousness and professionalism.\n\nFavouring lighter mechs, usually equipped with relatively 'low-tech' but reliable and easy to repair parts, Sierra3 is known to track his quarries across the stars at a relentless pace that few can match. If they go to ground, he has no qualms about hunting them down on foot, digging them out of their hide to face his brand of frontier justice. However, do not believe that these choices hinder him in any way, as he is known to be an incredible duelist and has a near impeccable record with the MRBC for completing the contracts he takes on.\n\nGiven his often grim personality, his somewhat reclusive nature and nomadic work, it is little wonder that Sierra3 has few whom he calls friends. For those who have earned this title though, Sierra3 will go to any lengths to protect and if necessary, avenge.\n\n<i>\"Sometimes, in the pursuit of the hunted/criminal/pirate/brigand/wascalley wabbit it becomes necessary to pursue them on foot... as they are want to evade capture by going into areas too small for 'Mech or vehicle to follow.\" - Sierra3</i>\n\n<i>\"In the arenas of Solaris to the fighting pits of the Periphery, there is nothing as bloodthirsty and profitable as old fashioned gladiatorial combat... whether it be opponents facing off with knives/swords/axes or pitting infantry versus a 'Mech, all for the pleasure of the crowds.\" - Sierra3</i>",
