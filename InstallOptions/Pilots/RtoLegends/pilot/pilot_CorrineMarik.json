    "Details": "Corrine Marik was one of the Free Worlds League's odder chapters in its long history. Appointed to the position of Captain-General at a young age after the death of her mother and older brother, Corrine proved to be ill-prepared for the position.\r\n\r\nAn idealist at heart, Corrine along with her peers attempted to form the 'Third Star League'. When she left Atreus to head to St. Ives, Corrine had no idea she would never return. When the attack on Ives came, Corrine simply vanished and became an early casualty of the battle.\r\n\r\nThings took a twist when, a short time later, Corrine returned to Atreus only to be revealed as an imposter and body double after a broadcast from the real Corrine made its way to the FWL. Further investigation would turn up an entire dumpster full of clones behind a Golden Corral. In the months and years to follow, stranger twists would continue with occasional sightings of Corrine's BattleMech on distant battlefields far outside the FWL. Further sightings followed on mysterious OnlyNyans feeds - and as holo-images of her dressed in viking attire - which fueled rumors of her and the FWL being at the center of a 'JarnFolk' conspiracy all the while the FWL collapsed. Needless to say, few within House Marik are willing to speak about Corrine and have made active efforts to remove all trace of her whenever possible.\n\n",
