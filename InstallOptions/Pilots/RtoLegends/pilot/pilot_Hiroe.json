    "Details": "Jameson \"Hiroe\" Davion was one of the Federated Suns' longest serving and most memorable First Princes. Like most of Davion's former First Princes, Hiroe was a subscriber to solving most problems by adding more autocannons and when in doubt, blaming Kurita.\r\n\r\nAs with other Successor Lords of the era, Hiroe went along with McDookie's attempts to form the 'Third Star League'. Though the attempt ended in disaster, Hiroe managed to keep Davion afloat and, despite losing a lot of ground, ended his reign with more territory than he had lost.\r\n\r\nIt was said that Hiroe once had a nightmare where the Lyrans were overwhelmed by pirates, the Combine destroyed by vikings, the FWL destroyed by sharks and cats and ComStar, and the Confederation buried under the many feet of a swarm of burrocks, leaving only House Davion standing and finally settling the question of first lordship. Sadly, Hiroe found he could not hope to claim that prize because of the threat of burrocks and bulls at this doorstep.\n\n",
