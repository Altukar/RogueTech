    "Details": "A cunning and ruthless dictator, Majorian was the first non-O'Reilly to ever reign over the Marian Hegemony. Majorian's road to power differed little from that of the O'Reilly family, rising from a high-ranking position and launching a coup d'Ã©tat. Once in power, Majorian killed or exiled the bulk of the O'Reilly family to prevent them from reclaiming the throne.\r\n\r\nDrunk on power, Majorian began a policy of expansion into the faltering Free Worlds League, often deriding the once great Successor State as little more than \"free real estate\". Majorian's cruelty did not go unnoticed, and eventually brought about an open war with Clan Wolf.\r\n\r\nThe war with Wolf went poorly and, in order to make peace, Majorian was forced to abdicate his throne and become a bondsman to the Clan.\r\n\r\nMajorian's bondsmanship lasted several years before he was able to free himself. With the Clan distracted by other issues, Majorian quietly slipped back into the Hegemony and quickly rebuilt support. He forced Hans O'Reilly out, making him flee to the Circinus Federation.\r\n\r\nMajorian quickly renewed his warmongering, launching a conquest of the neighboring Magistracy of Canopus. Catching the Magistracy largely unprepared, the Hegemony ultimately conquered much of Canopus despite support from numerous allies bolstering the MAF.\r\n\r\nMajorian's rule went unimpeded for several years, until Hans O'Reilly returned with forces from the Circinus Federation and launched a surprise operation to put himself back on the throne. Unfortunately for the pirates, the Marian forces seemed to have had some warning of the invasion and were well-prepared, repelling the pirates and pushing them back in a counter-invasion. Ultimately, this cost the Federation large portions of its Illyrian and Lothorian conquests.\r\n\r\nAfter forcing the pirates to peace terms that favored the Marians, Majorian would reach his crowning achievement when the infuriated High-Khan Fiona Kerensky of Clan Wolf delivered a batchall via a large marble slab dropped from orbit onto the emperor's palace. It is said that the slab very nearly killed the malevolent ruler when it destroyed his favorite bathroom - which he had been in just minutes before.\r\n\r\nMajorian accepted the High-Khan's batchall and prepped himself for personal combat with the Khan and her second. While Majorian himself was a rather average MechWarrior, his second, Somaru was, unfortunately for the Khan, one of the most skilled MechWarriors to have ever been born. Somaru proceeded to decisively win the batchall and, from there on out, few would challenge the now power-drunk emperor.\r\n\r\nWhile elements of the MAF would eventually reclaim large portions of the the former Canopian territory, Majorian's Marian Hegemony remained cemented as the major power in the rimward Inner Sphere for many years to come.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for the emperor himself, his reign was cut short. After ruling the Hegemony for a grand total of 58 years, Majorian found himself slain by his second, as Somaru seized power for himself just after Majorian had finished teaching him everything he knew.\n\n",
