    "Details": "What drives a mercenary? For some it's the thrill of battle, for others it's the chance to fight for a righteous cause. Others still are in it only for the money - or to commit war crimes. Blaen, however, is after only one thing: salvage.\r\n\r\nWhile no records confirm it, Blaen himself states he was born and raised on Arlanda, a system once part of the the former Rim Worlds Republic and one that, according to ComStar, has long since been abandoned. Blaen won't say much more about his upbringing or how we was able to leave a system no JumpShips would visit. Regardless of how he escaped, it is clear that Blaen has been hunting all forms of LosTech available on the battlefield.\r\n\r\nIt is said that many factions are overjoyed to have a MechWarrior of his ability join their ranks, but are equally saddened when he leaves after acquiring whatever technology he was hunting. Such is his reputation that even strict Clans such as Jade Falcon have been known to hire him.\r\n\r\nA word of warning though: If you wish to hire Blaen, make sure you have the tech to give him - because once it dries up, he will move on to someone who does have it. Many have questioned what Blaen does with his horde of technology - given that it rarely shows back up on the market - and some suggest he is secretly smuggling it back to his homeworld. But for what purpose, no one knows.\n\n",
