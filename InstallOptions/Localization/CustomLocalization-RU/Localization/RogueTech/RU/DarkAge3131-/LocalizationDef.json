      "content": "The Alpha Wolf's initial specification called for a blend of the Warwolf and Timber Wolf in an assault 'Mech package, with the Wulfen's stealth armor. It shares electronics packages with the Wulfen and Warwolf —amongst others— more as a means to streamline development than for any advanced abilities of the systems themselves. Applying the Wulfen's stealth armor onto an assault 'Mech raised eyebrows initially, although this decision hinged not on a desire for the Alpha Wolf to fill roles traditionally associated with stealth, such as scouting and infiltration. Rather, the benefits that stealth armor offered in disrupting enemy targeting systems cemented the selection, as it would allow the Alpha Wolf to survive longer in standup fights.",

The Awesome's massive firepower also lends it to defensive actions, acting as a mobile turret when necessary. Because of its reliance on PPCs, the Awesome is able to act independently for extended periods of time. This trait is also useful in siege situations where the 'Mech can keep up a constant barrage, allowing it to win battles of attrition through bleeding an enemy dry. The only downsides to the Awesome is its low maneuverability and lack of rear-facing weaponry, making it vulnerable to being outflanked and surrounded by lighter 'Mechs, although good intelligence and a well-deployed screening force can mitigate this issue.",

      "content": "The Ostroc carries as its primary weapons two Fuersturm-C Large Lasers in the left and right torsos. These give the Ostroc good medium to long range damage capabilities. The Ostrocs secondary weapons are two Fuersturm-b Medium Lasers also mounted in the side torsos and a Totschlagen SRM-4 launcher in the right torso for close-range combat, with one ton of reloads carried in the center torso. While the Ostroc's laser-heavy weapons payload allows it to operate well as a guerrilla fighter since it has limited dependency on supply lines, its short arms are a handicap in close combat, and the shocks of hand-to-hand fighting can easily damage the Fuersturm systems.",

      "content": "This Wolf Empire variant is a much more thorough melding of Inner Sphere and Clan technologies. Built around a few central Inner Sphere-grade components - a 270-rated XL engine, seven standard jump jets, and an endo steel frame - while clad in five and a half tons of Clan-grade ferro-fibrous armor. Now better armored than the original and capable of a remarkable 151 km/h top speed, the Pack Hunter 5's sole weapon is the Clan-tech ER PPC that gave the original model its bite. Though this means the 5 is still plagued by the original's inability to engage multiple opponents, the sheer speed gained in this upgrade makes it ever easier to avoid most return fire.\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Особенность: Reinforced Legs</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Множитель стоимости высадки: 1.05</color></b>",

Equipped with an ER Large Laser and two SRM-4 launchers, the Arion is capable of delivering devastating firepower at medium to long ranges. With a top speed of 97 km/h, it can rapidly traverse the battlefield and reposition as needed. The Arion's conversion capability allows it to operate as either a fast, heavily armed BattleMech or a heavily armored tank with a low profile, depending on the mission's needs. In BattleMech mode, the Arion is capable of agile and dynamic movements, thanks to its quadrupedal design. When converted to a tank, the Arion provides an armored, low-profile platform with a powerful punch. Despite its versatility, the Arion is not as heavily armored as traditional BattleMechs, and its conversion process takes time and resources, making it less effective in rapidly changing combat situations.

The Orion’s standard right torso ballistic weapon was replaced by an ER large laser, both for weight and range. Having been burned by the superior range of extended LRMs, the Wolves are experimenting with the weapon system on the C 2.\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Особенность: Противовоздушное наведение</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Множитель стоимости высадки: 1.15</color></b>\n\n<br><br><color=#FFEF00>Лимит приводов рук: Left Lower, Right Lower</color>",

The 'Mech utilizes Irian's Compact Engine and Compact Gyro to save space at the expense of mass. It retains the speed and ECM of the 9Q, but utilizes an Endo Steel structure. Two Heavy PPCs deal a good amount of damage in each blow, while a Snub-Nose PPC is deadly and accurate at close range. At the time of its introduction the 10KM was reserved for only the elite units of the Free Worlds League and Draconis Combine, and thanks to an iron-clad contract even the wily Irian Technologies had trouble finding a loophole to sell the 'Mech to the other Houses or mercenary units.\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Quirk: Battle Fists</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 1.2</color></b>\n\n<br><br><color=#FFEF00>Arm Actuator Limits: Left Lower, Right Lower</color>",

This speed gives it an additional degree of protection beyond its six and a half tons of ferro-fibrous armor and its Clean Sweep laser anti-missile system. Its key component is its Clan designed light active probe, making it a valuable scout while leaving enough room for additional equipment.
