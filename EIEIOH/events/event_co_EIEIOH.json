        "Details" : "A knock sounds on your office door and you push a button on your desk to open the door.\r\n\r\nYang strides in with a datapad, \"Boss, remember awhile back you asked me to look into any ways we can improve MechWarrior performance?  Well, I was looking through one of the back issues of TechSpecs, and there was an article about [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreEnhancedImagingDisplay],Enhanced Imaging Displays]].\"\r\n\r\nYou lean back in your chair and motion Yang to have a seat, \"Refresh my memory again, how will this help us?  Don't we already have mechs with these displays?\"\r\n\r\nYang sits down, \"So Boss, the displays by themselves are great.  BUT, when paired with a MechWarrior that has [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreNeuralImplant],Enhanced Imaging Neural Implants]], we could couple them with [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreEnhancedImaging],Enhanced Imaging]] displays in the cockpit to greatly enhance their performance.\"\r\n\r\nYou lean forward, arms on crossed on your desk, \"And the downsides?  There are always downsides...\"\r\n\r\nYang sighs, \"Well, yeah Boss.  It's not without danger.  The first step is having the chosen MechWarrior undergo the implant surgery.  Provided they survive that, then we have a few weeks of training in the simulators.  After that, they should be good to go in the field.\"\r\n\r\nYou think about it for a few minutes in silence, \"So, nothing else to worry about? And how risky is the surgery?\"\r\n\r\nYang looks at his datapad, \"The article states that most patients come through with no issues and can be in the field in about a month.  Worst case, of course is something goes wrong and they die during the procedure, but that apparently is extremely rare, like 1% or something.\r\nThe only other thing the article mentions is the combat time for the MechWarrior is reduced.\"\r\n\r\nYour look turns to concern, \"Reduced?  What does <i>Reduced</i> mean?\"\r\n\r\nYang continues, \"Let me see... it says here, and I quote: <i>'EI inflicts serious side effects on the user, including possible mental instability, nerve damage and death.'</i>\"\r\n\r\nYou ponder all this information before speaking, \"So the only ethical way to use this system is with volunteers then.  Yang, get with Medical and have any volunteers checked out to see if they are suitable candidates.\"\r\n\r\nYang hands over the datapad, \"Already ahead of you on that Boss.  Here are the first three volunteers:\r\n\r\n[[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]]\r\n[[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]]\r\n[[TRT_MW,{TRT_MW.Callsign}]]\r\n\r\nYou just need to sign that form on the screen and we can proceed from there.\"",
