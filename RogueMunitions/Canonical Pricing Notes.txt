Canonical Pricing Notes

Deliberate changes:

Chem Lasers
Most AC2 price increased.
UAC2 - Doubled to match UAC generally being more expensive than standard AC
NARCs - just too many differences in implementation

Questionable Canon Pricing

ATM/iATM - Astonishingly expensive

Tandem and Precision AC ammo - Astonishingly expensive

Arrow IV overpriced relative to other arty if not for a guided missile?

HVAC overpriced, especially the 20. (which isn't canonical, but pricing is extrapolated.)

MRM ammo underpriced?

Caseless ammos underpriced? Capacity is doubled but canonical prices are generally 50% more. So caseless shots are cheaper.
