    "Details": "This Blakist Jihad Stalking Spider has been made into a Work of Art to be honest. The Eight Improved Jump jets are still in, but rewired, redistributed and a little bit improved. Somewhere they found some Wings and bolted them on too. All of the 4 Legs in this Quad have been upgraded to the extreme. I'm talking about special Actuators, Talons and Jump Jets in each. Nearly all of the weaponry has been removed, except for a Single Laser that looks like it's going to fall off any second, with some bolted on Inferno Rockets. The Heatsinks and the Gyro have been both upgraded, The Engine was downsized and rewired to go into the Jump Jets to increase the Flight Time. The Cockpit has, too, been reworked and been given a Hotseat, Sensors for Increased Flight Calculations and a Gladiator FCS. I can Tell you one Thing, if this Thing starts flying, it will be one hell of a Bullet.\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Quirk: Stable Weapons</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 1.1</color></b>",
