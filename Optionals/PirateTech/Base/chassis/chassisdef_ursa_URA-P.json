They put in some kind of TAG System in the Head but its taking up a lot of space. The MASC and XL engine have been ripped out to make space for some kind of Fuel intake for a Nitro Canister to increase its speed. Parts of the Armour have been lined with Spalling, to decrease Shrapnel that might come off of this thing for whatever Reason. There is also a Double Heatsink kit in there, to my surprise. This thing will blow itself up anyway as soon as that Nitro reaches the Core.\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Quirk: Stable Weapons</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 1.09</color></b>",
