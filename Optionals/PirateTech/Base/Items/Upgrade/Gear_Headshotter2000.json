    "Details": "What is this mishmash of Doering Electronics' HPCS and salvaged targeting computers? Talk about a recipe for disaster! Just look at the interface — talk about shoddy craftsmanship! It's like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. A pirate neutral interface? More like a \"not fit for a gerbil\" interface. You'd have better luck using a rusty spoon to target your weapons. And to top it all off, I've heard rumors that the thing starts cannibalizing the equipment around it on failure. Imagine being in the heat of battle and suddenly finding your BattleMech stripped for parts — literally! Whoever thought this contraption was a good idea must have been swigging too much space grog. If you're willing to bet your MechWarrior's hide on this heap of space trash, be my guest. But don't say I didn't warn ye!",
