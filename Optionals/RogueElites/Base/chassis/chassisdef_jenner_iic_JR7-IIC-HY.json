Looking at the Specs of this 'Mech, it definitely fills that Role. The speed of this 'Mech, together with its upgrades, leaves me to believe this was designed to ram its opponents. There are spikes on every part, upgraded Leg Actuators, and Protective Padding all over the whole 'Mech. All of the electronics have been upgraded to support the calculations and projections needed in melee combat. If it can't ram, it has just two micro lasers to fall back on.\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Quirk: Improved Lifesupport</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 1.12</color></b>\n\n<br><br><color=#FFEF00>Arm Actuator Limits: Left Upper, Right Upper</color>",
