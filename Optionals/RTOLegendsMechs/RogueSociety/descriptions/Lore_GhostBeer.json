  "Details": "Ghost Beer is a strong alcoholic beverage made by Clan Ghost Bear on Arcadia.  While it has the name beer, it only resembles beer in the sense that it is carbonated.  Distilled from a unique snow white coloured wheat-like plant indigenous to Arcardia, Ghost Beer packs quite a punch for those fooled into thinking it is just a beer.  A clear white bubbly liquid with a foamy head, coupled with an alcohol content of 40%, has most from the Inner Sphere describing it as <i>Carbonated Vodka</i>.",
