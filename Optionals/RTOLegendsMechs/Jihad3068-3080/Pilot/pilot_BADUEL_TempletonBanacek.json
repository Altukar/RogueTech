Relegated to the motorpool, Templeton used his wile and charisma to work his way up the ranks and became a Star Captain, commanding both 'Mech and vehicle Stars. His ability to procure almost anything even when on remote battlefields allowed his Cluster to win most of their battles, even when sorely outnumbered and running low on supplies.\n\n",
