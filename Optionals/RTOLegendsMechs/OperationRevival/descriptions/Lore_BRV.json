  "Name": "Battlemech Recovery Vehicle",
  "Details": "BattleMech Recovery Vehicle (BRV) is the generic name for a class of heavy truck designed to recover BattleMechs (or parts of 'Mechs) from a battlefield. Equipped with a winch that can move up to 60 tons, the standard BRV looks like a large tow-truck. Using the winch, a damaged 'Mech is pulled onto the BRV's attached trailer. The BRV then delivers the 'Mech to the nearest repair facility.\n\r\n\rIn addition to being used by techs to recover damaged 'Mechs from a battlefield, these vehicles are sometimes used to move 'Mechs across roads that would otherwise shatter under the 'Mech's feet. The eighteen wheels of the BRV and trailer disperse the weight more evenly across a road surface, allowing 'Mechs to be shipped across a planet.\n\r\n\rWeighing in at 70 tons, the Heavy BRV is a larger version of the standard BRV and can winch and haul up to a 100-ton BattleMech. Though it can carry nearly twice as much weight as the standard BRV, the Heavy version is equipped with a smaller engine. As a result, carrying any 'Mech heavier than 30 tons will slow it to a crawl (32 km/h).  Since the crew is more likely to come under fire, the Heavy BRV carries five times as much armor as its smaller sibling.",
