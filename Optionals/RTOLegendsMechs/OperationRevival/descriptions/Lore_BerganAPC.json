  "Details": "The backbone of any vehicular military unit, APCs have been carrying infantry since the days of pre-spaceflight Terra and even in the era of battle armor, continue in their most mundane of roles.  What makes this particular variant stand out, is the interior.  While the outside of the APC is fully armoured and even armed with SRM-2 launcher, the interior has been fully gutted and replaced with leather seats, chilled mini-bar and a state of the art sound system.",
