        "Details" : "The holoscreen hums quietly as you scroll through the Mercenary Review Board's hiring records, your eyes scanning line after line of potential candidates. Names, callsigns, and contract terms flicker past in cascading text, each one a possible asset—or liability—for your company. The MRB's database is as comprehensive as ever, listing everything from green pilots fresh off Solaris VII to hardened veterans looking for their next payday. But one entry catches your attention.\r\n\r\nMiG—a MechWarrior pilot available for hire under a Letter of Marque. You pause, opening the file for a closer look. The contract details are straightforward: MiG would be bound to your company for a period of three to five years, a flexible term that allows the pilot to exit anytime after the third year but no later than the fifth. If you choose to terminate the contract prematurely, the MRB stipulates that your company will be barred from issuing another Letter of Marque for MiG until the original term runs its course. A reasonable safeguard, ensuring employers honor their commitments.\r\n\r\nWhat's more, should MiG complete the contract, nothing prevents you from rehiring them—so long as you operate within a populated Steiner star system. The clause suggests an existing preference for Lyran space, or perhaps MiG has local ties there. Either way, it presents an interesting opportunity: a pilot bound to your unit for a significant term, but with the freedom to walk away after proving themselves. It's a gamble, but then again, what in this line of work isn't? You lean back in your chair, considering the possibilities.",

You've seen plenty of pilots come and go, but MiG's dossier stands out—not because of flashy tournament wins or some noble pedigree, but because of one brutal, undeniable statistic: an uncanny number of confirmed headshots against OpFor BattleMechs. No matter the mission, no matter the tonnage, MiG had a habit of putting the enemy's cockpit in their crosshairs and sealing the deal with a single, well-placed shot. Some might call it luck. You call it talent.\r\n\r\nWith a final nod, you press the <color=#028A00>**Confirm**</color> button. The contract finalizes with a quiet chime, locking MiG into your company for the next three to five years.

What's up?\"\r\n\r\n\"We've got a new pilot coming onboard. Callsign MiG. Just signed a Letter of Marque, minimum three-year contract.\"\r\n\r\nDarius lets out a low whistle. \"Letter of Marque? You must really like this one. What's their angle?\"\r\n\r\n\"Headshots.\"\r\n\r\nThere's a pause. \"Come again?\"\r\n\r\n\"They don't miss, Darius. Not when it counts. OpFor reports are stacked with cockpit kills. They either have the best gunnery instincts I've ever seen, or they've made a deal with some old Star League ghost.\" You glance at the file one last time before closing it. \"Get them squared away when they arrive. Assign a bunk, and let Yang know we've got a specialist joining the lance.\"\r\n\r\nDarius chuckles. \"A headhunter, huh? Bet the OpFor's gonna love that.\"\r\n\r\nYou smirk. \"Yeah. Let's hope they never see it coming.\"\r\n\r\n<color=#f69c24>Hiring fee for Gerheardt 'MiG' Forsythe has been deducted from your account\r\n\r\nGerheardt 'MiG' Forsythe is now in your barracks</color>",
