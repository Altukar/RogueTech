Darius broadcasts their hail to the bridge.\r\n\r\n\"You're flying through {TGT_SYSTEM.OwnerDef.ShortName} space, travelers.  You are required to submit to boarding by Customs Officials of the [[TGT_SYSTEM,{TGT_SYSTEM.Name}]] system.  Do you comply?\"\r\n\r\nWhile you consider your options, Darius pipes up. \"Commander, do we really have to allow them to do this?\"\r\n\r\nYou open the channel to respond, \"We are an authorized mercenary company operating under the purview of the MRB.  Is there really a need for this inconvenience?\"\r\n\r\nThe Customs Official responds, \"We have had an increase in contraband entering through the local spaceport.  As such, the Governor has decided to search all incoming vessels in the area.  You can refuse, wherein we will report the matter will to the appropriate authorities, which in your case is the MRB.  I suspect you will lose some standing with them if you go that route.  Otherwise, just give us clearance to dock, we will do a quick inspection and provided no contraband is found, you can be on your way.\"",
