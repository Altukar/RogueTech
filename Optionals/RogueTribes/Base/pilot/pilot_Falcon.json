    "Details": "Cassius was seemingly born to be in the skies; from his earliest memories, he has always dreamt of being a pilot. However, when the time came to graduate flight school, familial and logistical complications interfered with his assignment to an air wing and led to him being drafted into Mechwarrior training instead. After some promising experiences in jump jet equipped light Mechs, Cassius ‘Falcon’ Gao found a new calling as a Mechwarrior and would go on to be known throughout his battalion as the first one to, literally, jump into the fray and sow chaos amongst the enemy.",
