    "Details": "Despite being third in line to inherit Fallstaff Electrical, Juno Fallstaff had little interest in research or managing production. Instead, the pugnacious woman leaned into the advantages her height brought to the table and threw herself into multiple disciplines of martial arts and frequent tournaments. Both habits did not stop as Juno joined up to become a Mechwarrior. On the battlefield, few are brave enough to attempt to slug it out with ‘The Bear of Third Company’ and even fewer walk away from the attempt.",
