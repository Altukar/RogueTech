    "Details": "A bit of a pragmatic traditionalist, Victor knows what he does and does not like, and will rarely be swayed from his opinions. As a result, Victor has spent a good number of his years in the cockpit riding in light mechs; particularly in his custom Panther which, while not a traditional Panther, has largely stayed the same and received only upgrades over its lifespan. Favoring scouting, picket, and skirmish line work, Victor is rarely seen outside of the cockpit and rarely socializes with others.\n\n",
