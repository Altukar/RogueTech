Originally serving as a tanker in the Second Armored Cavalry, his alienation was only deepened as he fell into a rare opportunity to train as a MechWarrior. After years of proving himself as a capable pilot, Seamus found himself in command of his own cavalry lance; a family of other misfit MechWarriors.\n\n",
