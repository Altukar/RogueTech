    "Details": "Like many of the protagonists in the pulp novels she is constantly reading, Lieutenant Julia Sergent can best be described as a strong-silent type. Juliaâ€™s storied career started in the infantry unlike most people of the Sergent namesake which seemingly forged the rather short and skinny teenager into a grizzled powerhouse by her twenties. At the age of 21, Julia was pulled out of the infantry and into a Mech where her determination led to years of success. In the few words anyone can get out of Julia at a given time, most find a kind wisdom that belies her hardened demeanor.",
