    "Details": "Seoyun may be getting old and grey by most Mechwarrior standards but her call sign, ‘Anvil’, is much older and has become a title reverently handed down through several generations. Younger Mechwarriors often guess at the origins of the call sign and most, much to Seoyun’s amusement, never get close to the truth. A steadfast and meticulous individual, Seoyun has spent many campaigns being a consistent and persevering presence for her compatriots while being a calculating and inevitable threat to her foes.",
