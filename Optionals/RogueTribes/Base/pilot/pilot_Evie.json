    "Details": "Bearing the weight of the McEvedy name is no easier task and, perhaps, it was particularly difficult for young Talulah. After several generations of McEvedy lineage delivering greatness through ingenuity, courage, and leadership, there were a mountain of expectations upon Talulah McEvedy. A rebellious and stubborn soul, Talulah was widely seen as a spoiled brat that enjoyed breaking the law; in fact, her application to Mechwarrior training came as a surprise to many and was actually rejected twice due to outstanding legal litigations. After some civil service, and possibly some bribes, Talulah was granted the privilege of joining a training cohort and graduated with top marks. Her early assignments have largely dispelled any concerns that the great name of McEvedy has come to an end.",
