It gets power from the Pirate Drive Harness and then overrides a jumpships NavCom to allow the console operator to substitute new coordinates closer to the target planet.  KF Consoles have 3 main parts: Kerby Injectors, Fu Capacitors and a Cheatah NavComputer.  Blueprints are also needed for assembly.  Doing specific Ambush, Rescue and Escort missions for Pirates will be rewarded with one of these parts.",
