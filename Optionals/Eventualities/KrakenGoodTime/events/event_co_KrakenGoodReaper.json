Who owes you this time, <i>Front Man</i>?\"\r\n\r\n<i>Front Man</i> smiles and ignores your question, \"You have an interesting side gig happening here.  Took me a while to work out your angle, but I know what you are doing.\"\r\n\r\nYou lean back in your chair, \"And what pray tell is it you think I am doing?\"\r\n\r\n<i>Front Man</i> pulls out a datapad and scrolls through it, \"You, my dear Commander, are deliberately hiring criminals hoping that they have come afoul of the <i>Syndicate</i> and I'll come knocking.\"\r\n\r\nDoning your best poker face, you contemplate this revelation before responding, \"Now why would I do that?  I visibly cringe every time you contact me.  Further more, I resent the...\"\r\n\r\n<i>Front Man</i> interrupts your tirade, \"Come now, Commander.  My records show you have made a few million C-Bills off sending pilots to compete in the games.  Your proclivity to hire criminals has been noticed, and not only by the Syndicate.\"\r\n\r\nYou stare icily at <i>Front Man</i>, \"You have the gall to accuse me of impropriety when you are running a 'game' geared at getting the participants killed.  You are a hypocrit.\"\r\n\r\n<i>Front Man</i> smiles evilly at you, \"Ah, see that is where you make a critical mistake.  I do not have to play by the same rules as you do.  You are a mercenary company, and ultimately answer to the MRBC.  Which means you can either risk losing precious reputation with them or reimburse the Syndicate a portion of the funds you've accrued feeding certain crew into the 'game'. Imagine being sanctioned by the MRBC and having your rating plument below 300 should they choose to investigate what happened to poor [[DEAD_MW,{DEAD_MW.Callsign}]]!
