How are you and {COMPANY.CompanyName} faring?  I trust things have been well?\"\r\n\r\nYou cross your arms in front of you, \"You just keep turning up.  Who owes you this time, <i>Front Man</i>?\"\r\n\r\n<i>Front Man</i> smiles and ignores your question, \"You are the clever one, aren't you?  Took me a while to work out your angle, but I know what you are doing.\"\r\n\r\nYou lean back in your chair, \"And what pray tell is it you think I am doing?\"\r\n\r\n<i>Front Man</i> pulls out a datapad and scrolls through it, \"You, my dear Commander, have someone on the inside allowing your <i>contestant</i> to get through all the game challenges unscathed so your company can reap the Champion's prize.\"\r\n\r\nDoning your best poker face, you contemplate this revelation before responding, \"Now how would I do that?  What resources do I have to be able to coerce someone on your payroll to look the other way?  Further more, I resent the...\"\r\n\r\n<i>Front Man</i> interrupts your tirade, \"Come now, Commander.  My records show your company, {COMPANY.CompanyName} has had more than 5 Champions.  Do you really know what the odds are of having 5 Champions?  By my calculations, the winnings from those are potentially enough to persuade one of my associates to look the other way.\"\r\n\r\nYou stare icily at <i>Front Man</i>, \"You have the gall to accuse me of manipulation when you are running a 'game' heavily weighted at getting the participants killed.  You are a hypocrit.\"\r\n\r\n<i>Front Man</i> smiles evilly at you, \"Ah, be that as it may.  The bottom line is, it is <i>my</i> game to run as I see fit.  You are under no obligation to hire criminals that have come afoul of the <i>Syndicate</i>.  Which brings me to the reason for me contacting you.  The <i>Syndicate</i> demands compensation for your deliberate efforts at ensuring your contestant wins the game.  And to show you we mean business, we have detained one of your champions, [[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]], on the surface of [[TGT_SYSTEM,{TGT_SYSTEM.Name}]], <i>(an image of {TGT_MW.Callsign} shows on the holoscreen, tied and gagged)</i> and should you decide to not pay up, then who knows what will become of them?  As a gesture of good faith, we will accept a payment of only \u00A27,500,000 C-Bills.  I suggest you choose wisely, Commander.\"\r\n\r\nDarius leans over to whisper in your ear, \"Commander, I've checked the logs and [[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]] did go down to the surface on shore leave.  They actually do have {TGT_MW.OBJ}.\"",
