    "Details": "The Pisces TD25-H set's itself apart from it's siblings by mounting a single Heavy Rifle instead of paired light cannons. Produced shortly after the TD25-1 its electronics are not fully modern. The Pisces Tank Destroyer is a simple low tech garrison unit popular on poorer worlds. Its main characteristic is efficiency, low overall weight, and simple components keep cost low. Relatively light weight weapon systems allow heavy armor for a vehicle in its class. Some variants suffer from poor mobility, but it was never designed with attack in mind.",
