    "Details": "The Estevez entered service by 2310 as one of the earliest and most effective tank designs developed outside the Terran Hegemony. With its sheer size and power the Estevez often caused lighter armed enemies to break and run, thus developing a fearsome reputation over decades of service. By the early 2400s, advancing technology had made the Estevez obsolete. Its main gun proved ineffective against more modern armor, made worse by its now-outdated fire control system. Its large crew and high fuel consumption also drained Armed Forces of the Federated Suns resources in prolonged conflicts. The Estevez was eventually taken out of front line service in the mid-25th century after a disastrous simulated battle against Draconis Combine BattleMechs on Robinson. However once in a while an Estevez liberated from a museum appears in irregular forces to this day. \n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Biome Restrictions: This unit can not deploy in Lunar or Martian biomes due to using an ICE.</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 3/5 hexes / 90/150 meters.</color></b>\n\n<color=#ffcc00><b>Armor:</b> Armor Primitive\n<b>Structure:</b> Primitive Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>       300     40\n<b>Left</b>         240     40\n<b>Right</b>       240     40\n<b>Rear</b>        200     40\n<b>Turret</b>      300     40\n\n<b>Total</b>      1280    200</color>\n\n<color=#ff0000>Quirk: Rugged</color>",
