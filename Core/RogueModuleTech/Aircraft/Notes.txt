Vulcan is now a standalone weapon pod like the wing mounted TAG and NARC

MOAB AOE dmg 500 to 400 matching nerf to daisy cutter from a while ago

Cluster gains accuracy and bonus dmg vs squads

External Wing Mount Bombs Are now available for salvage from VTOL and equipable on LAMs.
Rack sizes are expanded from generally 1, 2, sometimes 4, to 1 through 5.
Racks can now all only drop 1 bomb per attack. (Subject to change. Maybe 2? Depends how)

LAM have a special hardpoint type in their left and right toros for Internal Bomb Bay item

LAM lost 360 firing arc while flying like other fliers before them. This has a specific additional reason:
Bomb Tossing: Bombs now have max range influenced by Evasivepipsmod.

AGM and ATGM merged, stats most similar to the ATGM previously exclusive to VTOL. Now only half a ton each, parity with Light AA Missile.

LAM Pheonix missiles: No longer Streak, lower damage, longer range. More shots per ton/rack than more specialized missiles.

Ideas:

LAM shouldn't use normal Bolt-ons? They have this whole category of bolt-on-like weapons special to them with some overlap. But some bolt-on are utility they should have like Flare AMS. hmm

If possible we should ask for a way to block/disable Bombs in ground mode.

LAM Turbines could increase Carry Weight (deprecate LAM_WeaponsBay item). It's literally more thrust.

Bomb Chute item, Antipersonnel or Missile hardpoint, internal bomb ammo type, one shot. Much more limited, or additional drops of basic bombs.

Wing Hardpoint Item: Increases ShotsWhenFired for WingMounted Bombs by 1.
