The way Land Air Mechs carry and use Bombs has changed.
Previously the bombs were in ammo boxes tha used Carry Weight instead of Tonnage, and dropped from a weapon that occupied a Specialist Slot.

Now a large selection of ordinance is available similar to what LAMs had previously, and what you've seen on VTOL.

There are two categories of aircraft ordinance depending on how it is carried Wing Mounted and Bomb Bay.

Wing Mounted: Each weapon is self contained. Uses special torso hardpoints. Uses Carry Weight. Causes Drag and must be Ejected after use to cancel the drag.
Bomb Bay: LAM have two hardpoints for Bays. Different bays have varying capability. Bays weigh 0 tons. Ammunition uses tonnage, generally 1-2 shots per ton. No Drag.

You can use both on the same unit. Wing Mounted gear is the easier option to augment a traditional mech build. Internal bays offer higher alpha strikes with bombs, and greater maximum capacities for dedicated bombers.

Vulcan is now a standalone weapon pod like the wing mounted TAG and NARC

MOAB AOE dmg 500 to 400 matching nerf to daisy cutter from a while ago

Cluster gains accuracy and bonus dmg vs squads

External Wing Mount Bombs Are now available for salvage from VTOL and equipable on LAMs.
Rack sizes are expanded from generally 1, 2, sometimes 4, to 1 through 5.
Racks can now all only drop 1 bomb per attack. (Subject to change. Maybe 2? Depends how)

LAM have a special hardpoint type in their left and right toros for Internal Bomb Bay item

LAM lost 360 firing arc while flying like other fliers before them. This has a specific additional reason:
Bomb Tossing: Bombs now have max range influenced by Evasivepipsmod.

AGM and ATGM merged, stats most similar to the ATGM previously exclusive to VTOL. Now only half a ton each, parity with Light AA Missile.

LAM Pheonix missiles: No longer Streak, lower damage, longer range. More shots per ton/rack than more specialized missiles.

"Rocket" types don't get internal ammo in my opinion. They have to be guided. So they can drop free, ignite and track.

Ideas:

LAM shouldn't use normal Bolt-ons? They have this whole category of bolt-on-like weapons special to them with some overlap. But some bolt-on are utility they should have like Flare AMS. hmm

If possible we should ask for a way to block/disable Bombs in ground mode.

LAM Turbines could increase Carry Weight (deprecate LAM_WeaponsBay item). It's literally more thrust.

Bomb Chute item, Antipersonnel or Missile hardpoint, internal bomb ammo type, one shot. Much more limited, or additional drops of basic bombs.

Wing Hardpoint Item: Increases ShotsWhenFired for WingMounted Bombs by 1.
