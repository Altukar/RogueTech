    "Details": "The Nano-Fluid Damper is still in prototype stage, but could be the next large step in reducing recoil of 'Mech-mounted weapons. Using a special hydraulic fluid containing a mix of high-volume, low-density nano-particles of various advanced polymer materials, the damper is able to reduce the recoil of even the heaviest of ballistic weapons. The damper is unable to handle recoils past a certain maximum limit or repeated firings, such as from Rotary Autocannons. These shortcomings, together with its prohibitively high construction cost, means it is still some way away from mainstream use.",
