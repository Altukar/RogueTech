    "Details": "Known Info: MechWarrior identifies by the callsign Raza5. Actual name or identity currently unknown. Circumstances of their prior history are unclear, but they are known to have been on Great Gorge during the planetary disaster of '36. Cause of disaster still unclear, but rumours on planetary net - subsequently partially verified by independent sources - indicate a mysterious Black Marauder was seen on the planet in the hours before the disaster. Raza5 has claimed that the Black Marauder is sentient and of non-human origin and that it is responsible for the disaster (and numerous other events across the local region). They also claim to be a member of an unknown paramilitary unit unrelated to any faction - historical or current. ComStar and Interstellar Expeditions both maintain they do not recognise the insignia nor the so-called \"Foundation\" Raza claims allegiance to. However, Interconnectedness Unlimited has claimed that Raza5 was a past employee of theirs and has posted an open bounty of up to 250,000 C-Bills for their retrieval or elimination.\r\n\r\nRegardless of the circumstances, Raza5 claims to be hunting the Black Marauder and that until recently their unit was operating from the independent DropShip known as the Raza. A DropShip known by that name was operating in the Periphery up until '26, but was lost with all hands under mysterious circumstances.\r\n\r\nRecommendations: Do not hire, the inconsistencies in their prior history and far-fetched story aside; crossing a corporation like Interconnectedness Unlimited is not good for business.\n\n",
