    "Details": "Savarok grew up in comfort in a family that worked hard to pay their way with their AgroMech repair and maintenance company. This comfort bred complacency, contempt and a rebellious attitude. Despite having a natural aptitude for piloting he slacked off, bad-mouthed his parents to anyone who would listen, and ruined potential career opportunities for himself. This culminated when an ill-tempered rant about a prestigious landowner - who was going to give his family enough business for generations - was overheard. After that the contract was only going to be honored if Savarok was removed - not only from the family, but the entire planet. In just a few hours, he found himself aboard a transport to the Periphery with only a rucksack of clothes and a pocketful of C-bills.\r\n\r\nOn his trip, Savarok realised that an AgroMech pilot was going to struggle for work. So he lied, begged, and borrowed (sometimes permanently) for any work, at every opportunity, at every port. This always ended in trouble, however, until he was picked up by a pirate mercenary company as a repair tech. As the opportunity arose to pilot the ramshackle pieces of metal the pirates called BattleMechs, he grew in confidence quickly - too quickly.\r\n\r\nHis rebellious nature reared its ugly head again, and after a severe disagreement with the pirate leader he found himself stripped of uniform and heraldry - and in an airlock, about to be spaced. Just as the leader was going to press the release button for the outer doors, a local government militia ship that had snuck up boarded the pirate ship. The pirates were all killed, and the militia troopers stumbled upon him in the airlock. With some quick thinking, he was able to convince the militia he was not affiliated with the pirates, and he was spared. This was the defining moment for him, as he realised he had been granted a second opportunity to live. He vowed to not let any of his past bad habits continue. Savarok now travels between mercenary companies as a MechWarrior, looking for good, honest work.\n\n",
