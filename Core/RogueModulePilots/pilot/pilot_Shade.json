While growing up in Aurigan space on Smithon offered the Volkov family a bigger fraction of safety and peace compared to many other Periphery states, Carson certainly put his luck to the test serving in both infantry and armored divisions for several years. Eventually, he took a discarded Icarus II chassis and found his way into the local gladiatorial circuit and from there, became a merc.\n\n",
