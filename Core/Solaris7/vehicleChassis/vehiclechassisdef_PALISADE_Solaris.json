    "Details": "A native of Solaris, Natalie Curwen was at one point a rising star in the planetary militia until her career was cut short amid unproven rumours of corruption and selling classified intelligence. Since being booted out, she has slowly worked her way through the various minor leagues while dealing in information and - allegedly - black market weapons. Driving a customised Palisade MBT acquired during her militia service, Curwen has some how secured a Clan LRM-20 augmented with Artemis IV and steady supply of ammo to go with it. Installed on her tank in place of the original LRM-15; the free weight created has been used to upgrade the Machine Gun to an AMS and add CASE to the magazines. Ferro Fibrous was used to improve the Tanks armour, particularly on the weaker flank and rear armour.\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Biome Restrictions: None.</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 4/6 hexes / 120/180 meters.</color></b>\n\n<color=#ffcc00><b>Armor:</b> Ferro-Fibrous\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>       270     30\n<b>Left</b>         210     30\n<b>Right</b>       210     30\n<b>Rear</b>        200     30\n<b>Turret</b>      210     30\n\n<b>Total</b>      1100    150</color>\n\n<color=#ff0000>Quirk: Main Battle Tank</color>",
