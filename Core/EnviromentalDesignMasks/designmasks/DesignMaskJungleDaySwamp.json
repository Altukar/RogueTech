    "Details": "Tropical biomes increase heat sinking efficiency by 10% due to moisture clinging to exhaust vents. This area is filled with swamps and bogs, which reduce movement for all units except VTOL and hovercraft. Light and medium units have their movement cost increased by 20%, while heavy and above have 30%.",
