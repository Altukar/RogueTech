    "Details": "Carl \"Cargo Vroom\" Vranich was born on Alpheratz in the Outworlds Alliance, and is often regarded as one of the most prolific vehicle designers to have ever lived.\r\n\r\nGrowing up in a rather spartan household typical of the Periphery, Cargo opted out of school in an early age with necessity forcing him to work as soon as he was able to help support his family. Initially Cargo learned the family trade as a run-of-the-mill vehicle mechanic, but it quickly became obvious that Cargo was meant for more as he showed a knack for not just fixing vehicles, but improving upon them.\r\n\r\nBy his 21st birthday, Cargo found himself drafted into the Alliance Borderers as a tank mechanic. There Cargo quickly rose through the ranks of the unit's engineering corps, proving not only hard-working but able to diagnose and and fix issues that even mechanics with 30 more years of experience with the same models could not.\r\n\r\nBy age 25, Cargo found himself the head mechanic of a detachment of the Borderers stationed on Cerberus, when fate struck in the form of a deep raid by DCMS troops. The Kuritan forces struck the base, scattered the battalion defenders, and began tearing through the hangars, destroying vehicle after vehicle. Provoked into rage from watching days of his hard work going up in smoke, Cargo grabbed a few of the nearest fellow mechanics by their shirts and shoved them into the tank closest to them. Taking charge, Cargo then proceeded to lead the completely green crew in fierce defensive action. Cargo and his makeshift crew not only held out while crucial reinforcements arrived, but also succeeded in crippling two 'Mechs and outright destroying one.\r\n\r\nFor his quick thinking and heroic efforts, Cargo was awarded some of the nation's most prestigious military service awards. When offered monetary awards however, he turned them down. Instead, he requested he be allowed to bring his beloved pet ferret with him to work, a request the rather stunned high command accepted.\r\n\r\nFor the next decade, Cargo served the Borderers in the dual roles of both head mechanic and tank commander in its command company before largely retiring from frontline service. This was at the behest of the Alliance high command, who had come to value his ever-increasing skill at designing vehicle variants that were both cheap to produce and extremely cost-effective.\r\n\r\nNow heading a design bureau, Cargo has become one of these most despised people alive to many MechWarriors. So terrifying are the designs he has produced that many a MechWarrior has called them \"bullshit\" or decried that 'Mechs, not tanks, are supposed to be the kings of the battlefield. Perhaps it is not surprising then that when Cargo makes trips to the field for studies, he does so primarily amongst other tank crews.\n\n",
