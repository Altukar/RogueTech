    "Details": "Lesser known than the mysterious \"Bounty Hunter\", but perhaps even more feared, is the enigmatic Jamie Rayson. Next to nothing is known about this elusive figure - including if he even exists.\r\n\r\nWhat few details are consistent place him as originating from the Deep Periphery, somewhere past the Vela Sheet. References to him go back to at least the early Second Succession War and a few more cryptic ones as far back as the beginning of the Reunification War, which has lead to questions of whether he is real or if a series of MechWarriors have assumed the identity over the decades.\r\n\r\nEither way, many acts have been attributed to this shadowy figure, most of them acts of mass destruction, war crimes or battlefields with no survivors where no enemy forces were known to be active. Needless to say, this has made Jamie a boogeyman amongst the armed forces of the Inner Sphere. Said to have been behind some of the Second Succession War's most barbaric incidents, it would appear that Jamie relishes the chaos and destruction he leaves in his wake.\r\n\r\nThe rare survivors who encounter him on the battlefield are generally left broken - and those who do speak of the experience tell of a heavy 'Mech of unknown make, adorned in all black with no unit markings present. Usually only spotted moments before the brunt of his assault, MechWarriors find their sensors and targeting computers failing or going blank just before weapons of fire scorch their 'Mechs until they shut down or suffer catastrophic engine failure or ammunition explosions. Then, just as quickly as it appeared, the 'Mech vanishes before their eyes, the air shimmering momentarily where it once stood.\r\n\r\nOddly enough, there seems to be a pattern to reported sightings of Jamie: Once spotted, many more sightings occur over the next couple of years, seemingly heralding periods of greater strife within the Sphere. Then, as the fires of war cool, the sightings simply stop - with no more occurring for at least the next decade.\r\n\r\nSome of the strangest rumors and legends interweave Jamie's with sightings of the equally elusive \"Mr. Bubbles\", painting grand conspiracies - including attempts to burn worlds largely untouched by the devastation of the Succession Wars, such as New Avalon.\n\n",
