    "Details": "Of the many wonders the Star League created, perhaps one of the most underestimated was artificial intelligence. Of these, perhaps the most important and forgotten was the seminal work of Project Rain.\r\n\r\nSpanning the better part of a decade, Project Rain laid the framework and rails for the many AI that would be created in the latter years of the Star League. The end result of the project was the creation of the AI known as RogueBot.\r\n\r\nWhile proving to be somewhat unstable, RogueBot was leaps ahead of its contemporaries and soon found itself busy taking over many of the more mundane tasks required by the Star League's bloated bureaucracy. By some accounts, RogueBot handled as much as 45% the paperwork required to keep the massive government working. Although the SLDF attempted to train the AI for combat, they were never able to succeed in much more than  making it useful for commanding a BattleMech.\r\n\r\nUltimately, despite its success and the role it played in history, RogueBot was largely forgotten by historians. As progress marched forward, other AI programs surpassed the bot, its monolithic architecture proving unfit to be adapted to newer technology.\r\n\r\nEventually, under pressure to keep pace with more advanced AI, the Star League initiated a project under the SLDF to commission a new AI to regain its edge, and began to shut down RogueBot. While they were successful, there are some whispers that suggest that the AI realized its fate and created a copy of itself - one that was never found and remains somewhere in the wild to this day.\n\n",
