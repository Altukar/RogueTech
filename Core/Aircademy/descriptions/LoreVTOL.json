  "Name": "VTOL",
  "Details": "A VTOL (Vertical Takeoff and Landing) craft is one that uses thrust to take off or land vertically, usually with the assistance of propellers and/or rotors. The most common VTOL craft is a helicopter, though traditional-looking airplanes can use vertical thrust to achieve the same result, often at a higher rate of speed. VTOLs often excel in situations where traditional aircraft would not have the space to take off or land, such as on aircraft carriers or in restrictive terrain such as mountains.",
