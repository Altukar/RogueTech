  "Name": "VTOL",
  "Details": "Developed to fulfill the Star League's requirement for a quick response VTOL aircraft that could carry a squad of infantry and their equipment, the Ripper normally carries elite infantry or Jump Infantry that need quick deployment or retrieval.  The Ripper, built from proven components for maximum reliability, uses a fusion engine to give the vehicle a significant range, as well as a high top speed, so much so that the infantry compartment is equipped with special acceleration couches to handle the strain of a high speed combat insertion. While the Ripper is heavily armored for a transport VTOL, carrying one and a half tons of Aldis Heavy ferro-fibrous plating to survive the high G maneuvers that are the hallmark of the craft, a small laser or even a well-equipped infantry squad can down the vehicle in short order.",
