Commander {COMMANDER.LastName} may please introduce you to Mr Zeng.\"\r\n\r\nYou stand up from your desk and extend your hand, \"Pleased to meet you Mr Zeng, you may call me {COMMANDER.FirstName}.\"\r\n\r\nMr Zeng shakes your hand, \"Please, call me Howe, nice to meet you as well.\"\r\n\r\nDarius hands you a noteputer, \"Here is the quote for upgrading the Gamma Pod to allow up to 8 more MechWarriors in our company.  As with the Beta Pod upgrade, we have three options to choose from and I...\"\r\n\r\nYou hold up you hand, \"Thank you Darius, but if you don't mind, we may as well let Howe do his job and see what they are offering this time.\"\r\n\r\nDarius stops talking and defers to Howe, \"Well, {COMMANDER.FirstName}, as you will see in the quote, there are three options for upgrading the <i>Argo</i>'s Gamma Pod:\r\n\r\n     <color=#1E90FF>Option 1 - Decline the offer.</color>  You will only be out of pocket \u00A210,000 to cover my expenses here;\r\n\r\n     <color=#1E90FF>Option 2 - Cost Saver Package.</color>  The Habitat Galore Cost Saver package aims to work with those companies that are on a very tight budget.  As such, the cost is subtantially lower, but there could be design/install issues;\r\n\r\n     <color=#1E90FF>Option 3 - Standard Package.</color>  With the Standard Package, you get most amenities and our workmanship is reflected in the cost.  While we can't say it will be flawless, we haven't had anyone with issues to date, that we know about;\r\n\r\n     <color=#1E90FF>Option 4 - Premium Package.</color>  This is the ultimate in meticulous installation and quality control.  Everything is triple-checked in person as well as thermographic, magnetic and sonar structural integrity scans.\"\r\n\r\nDarius looks over to you, \"What is your decision, Commander?\"",
