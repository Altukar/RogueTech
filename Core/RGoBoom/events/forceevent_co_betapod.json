We have three options to choose from and I...\"\r\n\r\nYou hold up you hand, \"Thank you Darius, but if you don't mind, I'm interested in what Izelda recommends.\"\r\n\r\nDarius stops talking and defers to Izelda, \"Well, {COMMANDER.FirstName}, as Darius has already pointed out, in there you will see three options for upgrading the <i>Argo</i>'s Beta Pod:\r\n\r\n     <color=#1E90FF>Option 1 - Decline the offer.</color>  You will only be out of pocket \u00A210,000 to cover my expenses here;\r\n\r\n     <color=#1E90FF>Option 2 - Cost Saver Package.</color>  The Habitat Galore Cost Saver package aims to work with those companies that are on a very tight budget.  As such, the cost is subtantially lower, but there could be design/install issues;\r\n\r\n     <color=#1E90FF>Option 3 - Standard Package.</color>  With the Standard Package, you get most amenities and our workmanship is reflected in the cost.  While we can't say it will be flawless, we haven't had anyone with issues to date, that we know about;\r\n\r\n     <color=#1E90FF>Option 4 - Premium Package.</color>  This is the ultimate in meticulous installation and quality control.  Everything is triple-checked in person as well as thermographic, magnetic and sonar structural integrity scans.\"\r\n\r\nDarius looks over to you, \"What is your decision, Commander?\"",
