  "Name": "LAM",
  "Details": "Originally conceived during the Star League era, the Land-Air BattleMech (or more commonly the Land-Air 'Mech and abbreviated LAM) is a hybrid military unit capable of transforming between BattleMech and aerospace fighter forms. This ability conveys great speed and flexibility at the cost of power and protection. LAMs are a preferred recon and raiding unit but their fragility and rarity made them uncommon in the original SLDF and increasingly so in the Succession War era. Save for a brief revival during the final years of the Word of Blake, the Land-Air 'Mech has been relegated to museums.",
