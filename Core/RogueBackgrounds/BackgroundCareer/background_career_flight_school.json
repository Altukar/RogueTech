  "BioDescription": "You knew you would fly someday; the only question was how to get there. A chance barfight with a visiting TDF Air Chief led to the opportunity to train in air combat. You took to it as you knew you would, putting up with any draconian policy if it meant more airtime. Eventually, though, your ego got you in enough trouble to ground you from combat-readiness, and you were relegated to the position of Instructor. It took four more years of kowtowing and favors, but you got all the parts in placeâ€”nobody expected you to commandeer a bird while quitting the job, but nobody could stop you, either."
