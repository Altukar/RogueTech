You also need to store/ready every vehicle you have that say it has BA bays in description.\n\n  Battle Armors now can mount friendly units and swarm enemies. Complete explanation can be read here https://github.com/ajkroeg/StrategicOperations \n  Use Mount ability targeting friendly unit to mount. To dismount use Mount ability targeting the unit BA is attached to. Any BA can mount vehicles with BA bays (this is noted in vehicle description). Most BA can mount Omnimechs. Some BA can mount any friendly unit except VTOLs and LAMs.\n Use Mount ability targeting enemy unit to swarm. If swarm is successful BA will attach to target and fire all its enabled weapons at absolute accuracy and with 20% damage bonus. On the following turn use "Done" button to continue swarming, or Mount ability targeting swarmed unit to dismount. VTOLs and LAMs can't be swarmed.\n BAs attached externally to a unit regardless friendly or hostile has 33% chance to be hit by shots hitting location BA is attached to.\n  You can use Swat and Roll (self knockdown) abilities to try to get rid of swarming BAs.\n  Battle Armors can no longer run (have run speed equal to walk speed) or perform DFA (DFA on BAs was always a proxy for swarm) \n AI units have a chance to spawn with BA attached to them. Chance and maximum number of BAs that can spawn is faction dependent and raise with difficulty."
